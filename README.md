# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A 2 layer neural network built from scratch using python to predict credit card frauds

This is my first ML project built from scratch, I have implemented forward-propagation, back-propagation and back-propagation checking.

Train data consists of 750 record.

Validation data consists of 250 records out of which 173 are fraud cases and 77 are non-fraud cases.

Result:

Overall accuracy of 70% is achieved on Test Data.
